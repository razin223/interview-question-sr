## Task Summary

- Completed with all the search filter except date field.
- ```Date field does not indicate what should I do. Also it should have 2 date fields like price (from and to). As I did not understand so I ignore that filter part. I could make it equal to created at field but that did not raise any sense to me.```
- Create and edit part is done with VueJS. I'm not familer with VueJS. So I'm skipping that part. I wrote the store method in the Product controller. I checked the VueJS code and found out that you are using AXIOS and forwarded the post request to /product url with post data. But to accomplish that part I've to check a lot of things and spend a lot of times. So for now I'm skipping. There are a lot of coding left there (varient select2 or something, image upload and storing to store folder, generate combination with varient and tag etc.). This can be done with pure JS with Bootstrap and Jquery, but as already completed with VueJS, so I do not want to change that and recreate that part.

### I hope you'll understand my coding skill based on my search code. This is my final submission whenas I fail or pass. 

# Thank you a lot for the opportunity.
